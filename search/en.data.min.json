Please ask in the support server if you\u0026rsquo;d like to use a drivefolder.\nTossing rundown Here is a brief rundown from the OneShot Discord Server\u0026rsquo;s Staff Handbook:\nWhen tossing a user (or, users), it is heavily advised to do so away from the public chats, to prevent any boiling over. Think of the \u0026ldquo;ooh, someone\u0026rsquo;s in trouble!\u0026rdquo; thing, that\u0026rsquo;s rather hard to quell. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to perform tosses in #old-factory.\nTo perform a toss, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to either mention a user, or use their IDs. IDs are much preferred, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need Developer Mode enabled for them. Settings \u0026gt; Advanced \u0026gt; Developer Mode. You can also use usernames, if that is easier for you.\nOnce you have their name, mention, or ID, simply use pls toss USER. If you are tossing multiple users, separate them with spaces, such as pls toss USER1 USER2.\nWhen tossing a user, @Sangou will create a new \u0026ldquo;session\u0026rdquo; for you, in üö∑ Lower Tower, with a max of four sessions open at a time. The tossed user (or users) will be pinged, and given a timer to respond. When they do, or when the timer expires, you will be pinged.\nDepending on the user, you\u0026rsquo;ll take your next courses of action in the session channel. If they are uncooperative, they likely aren\u0026rsquo;t a good fit for the server. Use your best judgement here.\nIf you need to add more users to the session, simply use pls toss again within the session channel, and they will be added.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re done (and you haven\u0026rsquo;t kicked or banned them), you can use pls untoss USER to untoss the user and return them to the public chats. If you run pls untoss by itself, it will untoss every user.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to close the channel.
