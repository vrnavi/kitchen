If the Survey system is enabled for your server, you'll need to supply reasons with your kicks, bans, promotions, demotions, and timeouts. This list is configurable by your server's admins.

## Convenience note

If you're using Dishwasher's commands to ban, the reason provided after the ban command will be used as the ban reason in the survey log.

Dishwasher will also pull reasons from the audit log as well if you ban through methods other than the bot.

This applies to kicks and timeouts as well.
