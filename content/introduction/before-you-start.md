Before getting started installing the Dishwasher in your ~~home~~ server, here's a few things to keep in mind.

{{< toc >}}

## Presently unfinished

Dishwasher is presently unfinished, and code is subject to change. This may result in a few errors at times. If this happens, please report the error in the Dishwasher support server, such that it may be fixed as swiftly as possible.

Some features may be missing as well, however they may be implemented upon request by suggesting them. Don't hesitate to improve the bot with your voice!

## Semi-public

Dishwasher is semi-public, due to Discord's limitations with non-verified bots. Dishwasher is unverified as it uses traditional commands done through chat, rather than through a slash command system. As a result, the bot is only allowed on 100 servers at a time. To use Dishwasher on yours, please bring up that you *will* actively be using it. Dishwasher will leave servers that do not use it.
