## What Sangou does

{{< columns >}}

### Advanced moderation

Keep track of your users histories with the logs function, aggregating a user's history over time, including warnings.

<--->

### Slash commandless

Don't get tripped over Discord's nightmarish slash command system, as Sangou allows custom prefixes to be set.

<--->

### Chat enhancement

Translate messages by reacting, get previews of linked messages, automatically remove super reactions, set reply ping preferences, and more.

### Simple configuration

Run one command, download your server's configuration, edit, reupload, done.

<--->

### Complex logging

Log everything. User changes, moderation actions, and server changes. Also log moderation actions to a publicly facing (if desired) log.

<--->

### And more

As a Kitchen Sink-esque Discord bot, there's a lot more that couldn't fit. Like reminders, Color of The Day, joinscores, timezones, anonymous reports, and more.
